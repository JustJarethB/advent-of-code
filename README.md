# Advent Of Code
A git repo to track my AoC responses. It is my aim to do this "properly". I plan to use the repo as practice for writing tests and experimenting with node focussed code rather than client style TS.

## TODO
- [x] Node
- [x] Git
- [x] TS
- [ ] ESLint / Prettier
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] FS structure
- [ ] Login to AoC & pull data?
